# Heart-Disease
For CS5402 at Missouri S&amp;T, one of my data mining assignments was to create a K-nearest neighbor model to verify if someone had chronic heart disease or not. 
For this assignment I helped a 'client' draw the connection between key biological metrics and chronic heart disease. 
The given data contains: 
age
count of cigarettes per day
total cholesteral
systolic blood pressure
diastolic blood pressure
body mass index
heart rate 
blood glucose level
CHD

There where missing data values in the BMI attribute, so I had to use simple linear regression to fill those data values.
Then I used three different values of K to determine which model was best. 

Heart-disease.ipynb is the jupyter notebook workspace. 
heart-disease-data.csv is the data with missing values. 
heart-disease-data-new.csv is the data after I used simple linear regression and filled in the missing values. 
Heart-Disease.pdf is my report on the data.
